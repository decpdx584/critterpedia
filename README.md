# Cabassa's Project 2: ACNH Critterpedia

## Planning
As part of our classwork on the Friday before project week we were instructed to begin planning out our project. I spent some time with one of my cohort's IAs (Adam) discussing my project idea and limited ERD and wireframes. I decided that this would be my planning checklist (for my first sprint over the following weekend):
* Clone the authorization boilerplate code we made together in class and push it into this newly-created repo. ✅
* Plan out and begin this readme ✅
* Create models needed for the project
* Create and use apiTest.js to write test calls for my chosen [API](http://acnhapi.com/)
